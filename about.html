<h1 class='pageTitle'>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, i'm Emily, i'm 24years old and live in Manchester, UK. I have taken online courses in Web Development, as well as teaching myself to the point where I have an excellent understanding of <span class="bold">HTML5, CSS,</span> and <span class="bold">JavaScript.</span> As well as a solid understanding of <span class="bold">Bootstrap, jQuery, Wordpress, Unix command line, Node.js, Express.js, and EJS.</span> This shows that I am very self-motivated and hardworking which is also
shown by my 2:1 honours undergraduate degree in Psychology from the University of Nottingham. I have experience in web development, creating personal projects from the ground up, from websites, to signup newsletters, to blog websites, which are available to view in the projects section. <br>
I am very comfortable with statistics and dealing with large volumes of data, due to designing and writing up copious amounts of lab reports during my degree, which provided me with excellent analytical and problem solving skills, and valuable experience manipulating data using R and PsychoPy. During my time at university I completed many group projects and presentations, providing me with excellent teamwork and presenting skills. In my spare time, I played for my Universities Ultimate Frisbee team, showing that I have excellent time management and self-organisational skills to play a sport at National level alongside my studies, this also further supports my excellent teamwork abilities and shows that I have the strong communication skills to develop strong relationships in and outside of work. <br>
I have worked in Hospitality for a few years which has given me excellent interpersonal skills, enabling me to talk to anyone in an approachable and cheerful manor, whilst also retaining important information about their order and needs, which can easily be transferred to interviewing clients about their desires for a project. Working in hospitality taught me to work efficiently under pressure, whilst being able to prioritise the most important tasks, which I believe is an essential skill when working in a fast-paced environment. <br>
I believe this position as a Junior front-end developer will provide me with invaluable experience of working within a commercial environment, and will enable me to learn and grow as a developer. I am aware that I do not have years of programming experience, but I am very passionate and eager to learn new things and grow as a programmer, and would love to be able to do this with the guidance of your team.
Please view my attached CV for additional details on my education, work experience, and achievements.
